# Note-Taker


# Introduction to the project
* Note Taker was born from the need to help people remember those important tasks that must be carried out. Note taker it is a very easy way to take all your important tasks. Can be tasks to be done throughout a day, a week or even a month.
# About this project 
* This app allows any user to take notes about pending tasks and save it into a database wich is a file called db.json. The user will be able to see all the taken notes. Once the task is done, the user can delete that note with a simple click, and it will delete that note from the database too.
Every time the user create a Note, this will have a unique ID and the Note will be added inside and array of objects inside db.json.

# Challenges
* The biggest challenge for me was creating the DELETE method in order to delete just one single note. With the help of the unique ID, I use a forEach loop to get the index for the specfic element that matches the ID.
